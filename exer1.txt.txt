#Git is an open source version control system initiated by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Git thinks of its data more as a series of snapshots of a tiny file system. Every time you use Git to commit or save the state of your project, Git basically creates a picture of what all the files looked like at that time, and saves a reference to that snapshot. Git is the version control system of choice for most developers as it has many advantages over other available systems.
GitHub, on the other hand, is a for-profit company that provides cloud-based hosting of Git repositories. It makes it easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHub's interface is so user-friendly that even novice programmers can take advantage of Git. Additionally, anyone can register and host a public code repository for free, making GitHub particularly popular for open source projects
